# pytorch-retinanet



Pytorch  implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

This implementation is primarily designed to be easy to read and simple to modify.
The objective is to combined the object detection and one shot learning algorithm into one model.
This model is behave as a common pipeline for all the different one shot learning algorithm.



## Results
Currently, there is no result to published as code modification is still in progress.

## Installation

#### Installing the right version of PyTorch 
This project is updated to be compatible with pytorch 1.1.0 and requires python 3.5


You can find other project requirements in `requirements.txt` , which you can install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Training
 *  `Run : train_custom.py`

Code modification is in progress..

### Inference
Inference is made on detection and siamese network

* `Run : inference.py`
